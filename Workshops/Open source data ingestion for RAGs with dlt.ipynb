    "In this hands-on workshop, we’ll learn how to build a data ingestion pipeline using dlt to load data from a REST API into LanceDB so you can have an always up to date RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "​We’ll cover the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract data from REST APIs\n",
    "* Loading and vectorizing into LanceDB, which unlike other vector DBs stores the data _and_ the embeddings\n",
    "* Incremental loading\n",
    "\n",
    "​By the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to write a portable, OSS data pipeline for your RAG that you can deploy anywhere, such as python notebooks, virtual machines, or orchestrators like Airflow, Dagster or Mage.\n",
